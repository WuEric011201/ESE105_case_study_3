% Calculate the resonant frequency 
resonant = find(band == max(band))*10;
% How are the shapes and/or amplitudes different?
% The filter is a bandpass filter. Frequencies at a narrow range around 1600 are
% allowed to pass, while at all other frequencies, the output voltage's amplitudes 
% are cut significantly. As
% the input's frequency grows higher, the output frequency increases as
% well. At the resonant frequency, the output amplitude gradually increases
% over time. Around the resonantn frequency, the overall amplitude changes
% over time. For low frequencies, the output is unstable 

%% For what frequencies ùëì is the output approximately the same amplitude as the input? 
%And, for what frequencies is it much bigger? Or much smaller? 
%Would you call this circuit a ‚Äúlowpass,‚Äù ‚Äúbandpass,‚Äù or ‚Äúhighpass‚Äù filter?

%% Interpret what you hear in terms of what you see in the voltage vs. time graphs.
%What do small or large amplitudes sound like? What do small, medium, and large frequencies sound like?
